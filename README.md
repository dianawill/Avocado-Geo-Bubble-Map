# Avocado Geo Bubble Map
 Plotly Express vs Plotly vs Bokeh to create a geographic bubble map of avocado prices in the US
 The Excel data file was originally from Kaggle.com but I edited the price in Atlanta to create a greater price variance.
 The three notebooks create similar geographic bubble maps of avodcado prices in the US. The objective is to compare the code required between the three python libraries.
