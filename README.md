# Avocado Geo Bubble Map
 Use Plotly Express vs Plotly vs Bokeh to create a geographic bubble map of avocado prices in the US. 
 The objective is to compare the code required between the three python libraries. The three notebooks create similar geographic bubble maps of avodcado prices in the US. 
 The Excel data file was originally  sourced from Kaggle.com but I edited the price for Atlanta to create a greater price variance.
